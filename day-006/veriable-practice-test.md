**Python Variables Practice Exercises**

---

**1. Basic Variable Assignments**
- Create three variables named `a`, `b`, and `c`. Assign them the values of `5`, `3.5`, and `"Hello"`, respectively. Print each variable.

**2. Swapping Variables**
- Without using a temporary variable, swap the values of two variables `x` and `y`. For example, if `x=5` and `y=10`, after your code, `x` should be `10` and `y` should be `5`.

**3. Concatenate Variables**
- Create two string variables. Concatenate them, and store the result in a third variable. Print the concatenated string.

**4. Arithmetic Operations**
- Calculate the average of two numbers stored in the variables `num1` and `num2`. Store the result in a variable named `average` and print it.

**5. User Input**
- Prompt the user to enter their first name and last name. Store these in two different variables and then print them out in a single line in the format: "Hello, [First Name] [Last Name]!".

**6. Type Conversion**
- Create a string variable with the value `"12345"`. Convert it into an integer and store it in a new variable. Now, add `10` to this integer and print the result.

**7. Investigate Variable Types**
- Create one variable of each type: `int`, `float`, `str`, and `bool`. Use the `type()` function to print the type of each variable.

**8. Challenge: Currency Conversion**
- Prompt the user to input the amount in US Dollars. Convert this amount into another currency (e.g., Euros) using a predefined conversion rate (e.g., 1 USD = 0.85 Euros). Print the converted amount. Make sure to handle the input correctly, ensuring it's a valid number.

**9. Explicit Type Conversion**
- Get two numbers as string input from the user. Convert both to floats and print the sum of the two numbers.

**10. Memory Address Comparison**
- Create two integer variables with the same value. Use the `id()` function to print their memory addresses. Are they the same? Now, do the same for two string variables with the same value and observe the result.
