**Python Conditional Statements: Comprehensive Test**

---

**1. Basic `if` Statements**

- **1.1** Ask the user for a number. Print "The number is positive" if it's greater than 0.
- **1.2** Accept an age from the user. If the age is 18 or above, print "You are eligible to vote."

**2. `if-else` Constructs**

- **2.1** Given a number, check if it's even or odd and print the result.
- **2.2** Accept a character from the user. If it's a vowel, print "It's a vowel". Otherwise, print "It's a consonant".

**3. `if-elif-else` Chains**

- **3.1** Take a numerical grade (0-100) from the user. Convert it to a letter grade (A, B, C, D, F) and print the result.
- **3.2** Accept a day of the week (e.g., Monday) from the user. Print if it's a weekday or a weekend.

**4. Nested Conditions**

- **4.1** Ask the user for two numbers. Print if the first number is greater, the second number is greater, or both are equal.
- **4.2** Accept a year from the user. Determine if it's a leap year. Remember: A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but years divisible by 100 are not leap years unless they are also divisible by 400.

**5. Combining Conditions**

- **5.1** Accept three numbers. Check if they can form the sides of a triangle (the sum of any two sides should be greater than the third).
- **5.2** Ask the user for a number. Check and print if the number is both positive and even.

**6. The `not` Keyword**

- **6.1** Accept a username from the user. If it's NOT "admin", print "Access granted".
- **6.2** Get an age from the user. If the age is NOT between 13 and 19, print "You are not a teenager".

**7. Advanced Challenge: Quadratic Roots**

- **7.1** Accept the coefficients of a quadratic equation (`a`, `b`, and `c`). Calculate the discriminant (`b^2 - 4ac`).
    - If the discriminant is positive, print "Two real roots exist".
    - If it's zero, print "One real root exists".
    - Otherwise, print "Complex roots".

**8. Real-world Application: Basic Authentication**

- **8.1** Create a username and password (hardcoded). Ask the user for their username and password.
    - If both are correct, print "Logged in successfully".
    - If the username is correct but the password is wrong, print "Incorrect password".
    - Otherwise, print "Invalid username".

**9. Bonus: Ternary Operator**

- **9.1** Accept a number. Use a ternary operation to assign a variable `parity` the value "even" if the number is even, otherwise "odd". Print the result.
