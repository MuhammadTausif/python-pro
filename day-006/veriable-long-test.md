**Python Variables: Comprehensive Exercise Set**

**1. Basic Assignments and Naming**

- **1.1** Create a variable named `python_version` and assign the version of Python you're using as a string. Print it.
- **1.2** Try creating a variable starting with a number, like `3_variable`. Observe the error you get. Write down why this error occurred.
- **1.3** Assign two variables in a single line: `x` to `10` and `y` to `20`. Print both.

**2. Swapping and Multiple Assignments**

- **2.1** Given `a=5` and `b=10`, swap the values without using a third variable.
- **2.2** Assign three variables, `i`, `j`, and `k`, in a single line the values `5.5`, `Hello`, and `7` respectively.

**3. Arithmetic and Type Manipulation**

- **3.1** Create two variables `m` and `n` with values `8` and `2` respectively. Perform and print all arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`).
- **3.2** Given the variable `floating_point = "15.67"`, convert it to an actual float and then to an integer.

**4. User Input and Operations**

- **4.1** Take two numbers from the user, calculate their average, and print it.
- **4.2** Accept a string from the user. Print its length, convert it to uppercase, and then print the modified string.

**5. Delving Deeper into Memory**

- **5.1** Create a variable `z` with value `50`. Use the `id()` function to print its memory address.
- **5.2** Now, assign `z` the value `25`. Print its memory address again. Observe and note down the change.

**6. Dynamic Typing**

- **6.1** Assign a value of `20` to a variable `dynamic`. Print its type.
- **6.2** Reassign `dynamic` the value `"twenty"`. Print its type again. Write a note about Python's dynamic typing based on the observed behavior.

**7. Exploring Scope**

- **7.1** Create a global variable `global_var` outside any function. Define a function that tries to modify this variable without using the `global` keyword. Observe the behavior and errors.
- **7.2** Now, modify the global variable from within the function using the `global` keyword. Note the difference.

**8. Advanced Challenge: String and Numbers**

- **8.1** Take a string input from the user that represents a floating-point number (e.g., `"3.142"`). Convert this string to an integer. Observe the error and handle it using a try-except block. If an error occurs, print "Conversion failed!".

**9. Exploring Constants**

- **9.1** In Python, constants are more about convention than enforced behavior. Declare a variable in all caps, `CONST_VAL`, and assign it a value. Write a note explaining why this is considered a "constant" in Python and how it's different from other languages.

**10. Real-world Application: Simple Interest Calculator**

- **10.1** Accept principal, rate of interest, and time as inputs from the user.
- **10.2** Use the formula `(principal * rate * time) / 100` to calculate simple interest.
- **10.3** Print the calculated interest. Ensure all variables are appropriately named and that the program handles invalid input gracefully.
