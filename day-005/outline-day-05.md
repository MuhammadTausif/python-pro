**Python Course: Day 5 Outline - Data Structures**

---

**1. Introduction to Data Structures**
- Why data structures are vital.
- Overview of basic data structures in Python.

**2. Lists**
- Defining and initializing lists.
  ```python
  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
  ```
- Accessing and modifying list elements.
- Methods: `append()`, `insert()`, `remove()`, `pop()`, `sort()`, and more.
- Slicing lists.
  ```python
  first_two = fruits[:2]
  ```

**3. Tuples**
- Introduction to tuples: Immutable lists.
  ```python
  coordinates = (4, 5)
  ```
- Accessing tuple elements.
- When to use tuples over lists.

**4. Sets**
- Understanding sets: Unordered collections with no duplicate elements.
  ```python
  unique_fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple"}
  ```
- Methods: `add()`, `remove()`, and more.
- Set operations: union, intersection, difference.

**5. Dictionaries**
- Introduction: Key-value pairs.
  ```python
  student = {"name": "John", "age": 18, "grade": "A"}
  ```
- Accessing and modifying dictionary values.
- Methods: `keys()`, `values()`, `items()`, `get()`, `update()`, and more.

**6. List Comprehensions**
- Creating concise and readable lists.
  ```python
  squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
  ```

**7. Dictionary Comprehensions**
- Constructing dictionaries in a concise manner.
  ```python
  squares_dict = {x: x**2 for x in range(5)}
  ```

**8. Practical Exercises**
- Implement a program to find the most frequent item in a list.
- Create a program that groups students by their grades using a dictionary.

**9. Introduction to the `collections` Module**
- Exploring `namedtuple`, `Counter`, `deque`, and more.

**10. Iterating Over Data Structures**
- Using loops with lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples.
  
**11. Summary and Q&A**
- Recap of the day's content.
- Addressing questions and providing clarifications.

**12. Homework/Assignments**
- Implement a "to-do" list program using a list.
- Create a contact book application using dictionaries where one can add, view, and delete contacts.
