Certainly! Here are 10 exercises involving integers in Python:

---

**1. Basic Arithmetic:**
   Calculate the sum, difference, product, and quotient of two integers provided by the user.
   
   ```python
   a = int(input("Enter the first integer: "))
   b = int(input("Enter the second integer: "))
   # Implement the arithmetic operations and display the results.
   ```

---

**2. Modulo Operator:**
   Ask the user for an integer and check if it's even or odd.
   
   ```python
   number = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
   # Check even or odd using the modulo operator and print the result.
   ```

---

**3. Age Next Year:**
   Take the user's current age as input and display how old they will be next year.
   
   ```python
   age = int(input("What's your current age? "))
   # Calculate and display the age for next year.
   ```

---

**4. Temperature Converter:**
   Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius. Formula: `(Fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9`
   
   ```python
   fahrenheit = int(input("Enter temperature in Fahrenheit: "))
   # Convert to Celsius and display the result.
   ```

---

**5. Compound Interest:**
   Calculate compound interest with given principal, rate, and time. Formula: `P(1 + r/n)^(nt)`, where `P` is the principal, `r` is the annual interest rate, `n` is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and `t` is the number of years.

   ```python
   P = int(input("Enter principal amount: "))
   r = float(input("Enter annual interest rate (as a decimal, e.g., 0.05 for 5%): "))
   n = int(input("Enter number of times interest is compounded per year: "))
   t = int(input("Enter number of years: "))
   # Calculate compound interest and display the result.
   ```

---

**6. Divisibility Test:**
   Ask the user for two integers and check if the first number is divisible by the second.
   
   ```python
   num1 = int(input("Enter first integer: "))
   num2 = int(input("Enter second integer: "))
   # Check divisibility and print the result.
   ```

---

**7. Area of a Rectangle:**
   Calculate the area of a rectangle using its length and width provided by the user.
   
   ```python
   length = int(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
   width = int(input("Enter the width of the rectangle: "))
   # Calculate and display the area.
   ```

---

**8. Seconds to Minutes and Hours:**
   Convert a given number of seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds.
   
   ```python
   total_seconds = int(input("Enter the number of seconds: "))
   # Convert to hours, minutes, and seconds, then display the result.
   ```

---

**9. Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):**
   Implement the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two integers.
   
   ```python
   a = int(input("Enter the first integer: "))
   b = int(input("Enter the second integer: "))
   # Implement the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD and display the result.
   ```

---

**10. Prime Checker:**
   Ask the user for an integer and check if it's prime.
   
   ```python
   number = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
   # Check if the number is prime and print the result.
   ```
