Certainly! Let's distinguish between `int` (integers) and `float` (floating-point numbers) with examples:

---

**Integers (`int`):**  
These are whole numbers (without decimals) that can be positive, negative, or zero.

Examples:
1. `5`
2. `-3`
3. `0`
4. `12345`
5. `-7890`

In Python, you can define an integer like this:
```python
x = 5
y = -3
z = 0
```

---

**Floating-Point Numbers (`float`):**  
These are numbers that have decimal points. They can represent whole numbers, fractions, or irrational numbers. 

Examples:
1. `3.14`
2. `-0.001`
3. `5.0` (Even though it's 5, the presence of `.0` makes it a float)
4. `2.71828`
5. `-9.81`

In Python, you can define a floating-point number like this:
```python
a = 3.14
b = -0.001
c = 5.0
```

---

**Additional Notes:**

In Python, you can use the `type()` function to check the type of a number:

```python
print(type(5))    # <class 'int'>
print(type(3.14)) # <class 'float'>
```

This will confirm that `5` is an integer and `3.14` is a floating-point number.
