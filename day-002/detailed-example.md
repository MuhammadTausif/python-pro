### Day 2: Basic Syntax & Fundamental Concepts

---

#### **1. Python Indentation**

   - Importance of whitespace in Python: Unlike many other languages, Python uses indentation to determine the structure of code rather than curly braces `{}` or keywords.
   
   **Example:**
   ```python
   if True:
       print("Indentation is important in Python!")
   ```

#### **2. Comments in Python**

   - Single-line comments using `#`: These are for short explanations or to temporarily disable a part of the code.
   - Multi-line comments using triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`): Used for longer descriptions, especially for documenting functions or classes.
   
   **Examples:**
   ```python
   # This is a single-line comment
   print("Hello, World!")  # This is an inline comment

   '''
   This is a multi-line comment.
   Typically used for longer descriptions or documentation.
   '''
   ```

#### **3. Variables and Data Types**

   - Assigning values to variables: In Python, variables are dynamically typed, meaning their type is inferred from the value they're assigned.
   - Introduction to basic data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`.
   
   **Examples:**
   ```python
   age = 25           # This is an integer
   height = 5.9       # This is a float
   name = "John"     # This is a string
   is_student = True  # This is a boolean
   ```

   - Using the `type()` function to determine the data type of a variable.
   
   **Example:**
   ```python
   print(type(age))   # Output: <class 'int'>
   ```

#### **4. Basic I/O: `print()` and `input()`**

   - Printing variables and formatted strings using f-strings.
   
   **Examples:**
   ```python
   print(f"{name} is {age} years old and is {height} feet tall.")
   ```

   - Taking user input with the `input()` function and type casting for appropriate data types.
   
   **Example:**
   ```python
   user_age = int(input("Enter your age: "))  # Convert string input to integer
   ```

#### **5. Arithmetic Operators**

   - Understanding and practicing basic operations.
   
   **Examples:**
   ```python
   a = 10
   b = 3

   print(a + b)  # Output: 13
   print(a - b)  # Output: 7
   print(a * b)  # Output: 30
   print(a / b)  # Output: 3.3333...

   print(a // b)  # Output: 3 (integer division)
   print(a % b)   # Output: 1 (modulus/remainder)
   print(a ** b)  # Output: 1000 (exponentiation)
   ```

#### **6. Exercises**

   **Variable Assignment:**
   ```python
   friend_name = "Alice"
   friend_age = 30
   hobby = "guitar"
   print(f"My friend {friend_name} is {friend_age} years old and loves playing {hobby}.")
   ```

   **Type Checking:**
   ```python
   print(type(friend_name))  # Output: <class 'str'>
   ```

   **User Input Calculator:**
   ```python
   num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
   num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

   print(f"Sum: {num1 + num2}")
   print(f"Difference: {num1 - num2}")
   print(f"Product: {num1 * num2}")
   print(f"Quotient: {num1 / num2}")
   ```

   **Commenting Practice:**
   ```python
   # Taking two numbers as input from the user
   num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
   num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
   
   # Calculating the sum of the two numbers and displaying it
   print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {num1 + num2}.")
   ```
