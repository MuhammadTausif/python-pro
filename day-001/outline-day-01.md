Along with the content, you can supplement your learning with exercises and mini-projects after each section. For example:

- After the **Basic Syntax** section, try writing a program that asks the user's name and age and then prints a message using those inputs.
- After the **Data Structures** section, create a simple to-do list program that allows users to add, view, and remove tasks.

Remember, the key to learning programming (and particularly Python) is consistent practice. Regularly working on small projects or challenges will solidify your understanding of the concepts you've learned. 

Good luck on your Python journey!
